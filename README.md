# ðŸŽ¨ Color Correction 

> **Note:** The "asdfghjkl" is just a placeholder due to some naming difficulties.

This package is designed to perform color correction on images using the Color Checker Classic 24 Patch card. It provides a robust solution for ensuring accurate color representation in your images.

## Installation

```bash
pip install color-correction-asdfghjkl
```
## Usage

```python
import cv2

from color_correction_asdfghjkl import ColorCorrection

cc = ColorCorrection(
    detection_model="yolov8",
    correction_model="least_squares",
    use_gpu=False,
)

input_image = cv2.imread("cc-19.png")
cc.fit(input_image=input_image)
corrected_image = cc.correct_image(input_image=input_image)
cv2.imwrite("corrected_image.png", corrected_image)
```
Sample output:
