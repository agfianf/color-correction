# ðŸŽ¨ Color Correction 

> **Note:** The "asdfghjkl" is just a placeholder due to some naming difficulties.

This package is designed to perform color correction on images using the Color Checker Classic 24 Patch card. It provides a robust solution for ensuring accurate color representation in your images.

## Installation

```bash
pip install color-correction-asdfghjkl
```
## Usage

```python
image_path = "asset/images/cc-1.jpg"
# image_path = "asset/images/cc-19.png"
filename = os.path.basename(image_path)
input_image = cv2.imread(image_path)

cc = ColorCorrection(detection_model="yolov8", correction_model="least_squares")
input_patches, input_grid_patches, drawed_debug_preprocess = (
    cc.extract_color_patches(
        input_image=input_image,
        debug=True,
    )
)
cc.fit(input_patches=input_patches)
corrected_image = cc.correct_image(input_image=input_image)
corrected_patches = cc.correct_image(input_image=input_grid_patches)
```
Sample output:

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform color correction across multiple images.
- **Accuracy**: Leverage the color correction matrix for precise color adjustments.
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable for various image sets with different color profiles.
